# Projects

**1.Burglar alarm system

  This system alerts the owner about the theft in the concerned premises. An alert message is sent on their phone and a buzzer connect to the circuit is also triggered.
  After this the room is latched so that the burglar can't escape.

  Softwares: MPLAB,ARES(for PCB),Proteus
  Hardwares: GSM,Microwave sensor,buzzer,pic-16f887 microcontroller,latch,relay and other resistive components

**2.Servo Radar

  It is a long-range object detection system.

  Software: Arduino IDE,Processing
  Hardware: Arduino, Servo motor, Ultrasonic sensor

**3.Traffic Light Control System

  • The main aim for this project was to minimize the time taken by an emergency vehicle (EV) to reach its
  destination.
  • It is a button-controlled traffic light system which turns the red light to green for a particular EV at a junction
  and turns all the other lane lights to red
  
  Softrware: Arduino IDE
  Hardware: Arduino nano,nrf24l01, LEDs
